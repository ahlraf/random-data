16,"Great course so far I'm about 2 sections through at this point or some 33 modules in The lecturer paces the content well gives good and detailed examples of the concepts they're speaking about and the information itself is more or less what I wanted - which was to understand human behaviour a bit better It's pretty clear the lecturer is doing one-takes, as there's the occasional awkward pause or correction in the audio but instead of being a negative I think it goes to show that he's really familiar with the content and lecturing in general Would recommend ",5
17,Content was well organised and presented with clarity and enthusiasm More variety of resources would be good for example video links as this would have helped me to remember the material better Otherwise excellent course ,4.5

28,"Everything can be found in other sources Nothing new and no original studies Talking too slow listened at 1,5-1,75 speed Good for people who just start studying psychology ",3
29,A good introduction to social Psych and possibly a good pre Uni course to undertake but could do with more user interaction in terms of work the students undertakes which may also increase the value of the course on completion in terms of being accepted to a Uni or college ,3.5
30,So far the information is easily understandable and piqued my interest ,3
31,Very informative Easy to understand Keeps the audience engaged ,5
32,Course seems to be fairly well organized and presented Looking forward to the remainder of the program ,4

50,Very enjoyable have ordered some additional reading/books good lecturer and he enjoys the topic and is good at getting across Also it has helped me understand myself more which is always worthwhile ,5
51,Can't decide whether to take this course Do a benefit comparison 1. This instructor is qualified to teach at University level 2. His courses are very thorough and detailed 3. The instructor takes a personal interest in his students and answers all their individual questions even like the dumb one's that I ask 4. The instructor's goal is to make sure you learn the information he presents so that you can use it 5. You have lifetime access to the course five years from now you won't have to try to find the instructor to ask a question 6. Now add in the cost of a couple of text books the provides all you need and links and resources to more resources 7. now add the cost for enrolling in a college course 8. Now calculate the cost and investment of all your time spent on going to class preparing for class and the time spent in class when you could have stayed in your pajamas Bottom line comparison You figure it out :-) The instructor and his courses are so good i that I've enrolled and taken many of his courses I wouldn't be investing my time and money with him i if there was somewhere else more profitable to me to do that That's what I think ,5
52,Being new to the field of Social Psychology I have found Andrew's course very informative and he is a fantastic communicator and teacher Highly Recommended for a Introduction into Social Psychology :-) ,5
53,Loved the course lots of information presented in a fun and easy to understand way ,5
54,This course is a better one than others I've done on the subject the presenter is easily likeable ,5

57,Love this course ,5
58,Interesting course ,4
59,informative well presented and relatively complete ,5
60,Great information and examples The delivery method could be improved with higher quality videos and less powerpoint type animations Thank you ,4

66,I am an aspiring psych and I have a degree of Bachelor of Communication Arts major in Journalism yeah too far I'm late bloomer thought Late in realizing what I want Even though I have a Psychology class back when I was in college this gives more details about psychology This allows me to crave more for psycho ,5
67,I think that this course provides a lot of interesting and useful information however on some of the longer videos it can get a little bland over all I recommend taking this course ,4
68,Excellent ! This online psychology course is easy to follow and the lectures presented general concepts of psychology in different ways with nice slides presentations and videos ,5

71,I found this course interesting and informative.Well presented 10/10 ,5
72,Is too simply and presentation are unclear but fanny ,3
73,Everything is explained nicely and logically I feel that I learned a lot from this course The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some of the videos need a little up dating--particularly a few towards the end where the slideshow featured vertical white pages The text was a little hard to read on some of the slides but I was able to keep up with the verbal presentation ,4
74,Es un excelent cursory ,5
75,Many of the slide were to small and the text could not be ready Slide colours and transitions were irritating and inconsistent but from about Section 6 onwards the slide style improved Audio volume levels tended to change from lecture to lecture and the special effect sounds were either to loud or irritating Content was good particularly attribution theory id ego superego conditioning and attachment theory and styles Size or time for each lecture was good and the pace was ok although the pace could go a little faster Good luck and thank you for the course I enjoyed it and learnt a lot about myself and others ,3
76,It pertains to the most instinctual behavioural pattern so layman can also understand the actual idea ,4
77,It was a good experience on the whole..The travel through different concepts of psychology was carried out in an organized and different manner ,4
78,dry Sharpsteen lecture series was simple to follow The use of slides definitions and movie application helped with understanding ,5

88,I liked even if it was a bit bias ,5
89,The course gives a good and easy-to-follow summary and overview about essential concepts of international politics analysis It gave me interesting new insights especially on the individual level of politics however I sometimes felt like some topics could have used a bit more details to be more than just a keyword of analysis All in all I can absolutely recommend this course for international politics enthusiasts and beginning students Intermediate students can also gain a good summary and inspiration from this ,4
90,Because the professor is a very good instructor ,5
91,Interesting content not something I've ever heard about outside this course ,5
92,So far so good ,5
93,I really enjoyed this course I already had some knowledge prior to passing the course however it helped me a lot to organise everything in my mind ,5

102,"Great course , you have made me to develop some interest in politics with this course This course will help you to take a second look at every news headline and be able to distinguish the noise of media and the facts is reality Great job ",5
103,It looks like this will be an interesting course We live in an era where information indeed flows and we cannot compete with the amount of them to understand what is gong on around the world Having those invisible analytical tools will therefore be helpful in understanding the contemporary international politics ,5
104,The instructor is very knowledgeable ,5

112,well presented and easy to follow ,5
113,"This course is a great introduction to the world of International Relations for students and all those interested The distinct contribution of dry Zwolski here relates to providing a clear and systematic map of the discipline which as many know can be very abstract and unnecessarily opaque at times Another important aspect in this course is the focus on the applicability of the insights for the student Many times International Relations scholars are accused of being self-indulgent, and doing theory for the sake of it This course takes a necessary step in addressing this deficit especially as International relations as a discipline finds itself in competition with many other frameworks for understanding and explaining the world This course is therefore recommended for all those who want to ask questions about the world of international relations in a rigorous manner informed by an adequate theoretical grounding and whom are eager to understand how to connect arguments to evidence Needless to say it feels that this task is becoming exceedingly urgent in the evidence and theory free world of Trump and brexit ",5
114,Good course that will provide a decent set of basic toolbox for your politics analysis needs Very well structured and clearly explained with good samples yes it did get my blood boiling on a few analytical conclusions which we'll have to agree to disagree about but this is exactly what good politics could should be doing I hope to revisit for updates on analytics on future subjects We live in a VERY interesting period of political changes and the tools will come handy I can definitely see myself repeating the course in a few months/year to ensure the concepts remain fresh thanks ,5
115,Good information on why I should choose this course Very clear explained IR theories ,5
116,The teacher is a well-versed expert on the topic I've only recently started the course but his thoughtful approach to the material and its delivery is very obvious I'm finding the course to be educational and very engaging I will update my review as I make more progress in the program ,5

152,Still too fast for e I take long hand notes Maybe a powerpoint of the screens would help Still too fast whips through slides I would like to examine further Otherwise good enjoying it Still want the Powerpoint of the slides Otherwise great refresher for cod hours ,4

167,A good recap or a preview to people who will be attending unit Though Freud and Jung missing from the history of Psych and no id Ego and Super ego The course covers a fairly wide field but misses a few section that you will be expected to research at unit On a side note the lectures could do with a little tweeting as some of the ends of lectures are not in the correct order for the next lecture Overall this should help anyone inbetween college and Uni thought ,3.5

173,Thoroughly enjoyed it I believe I've learnt just as much from this course than that of my Psychology study at university It was a great refresher course and so much more Very well done Thank you elvira ,5
174,It's not clear that I'm actually required to do any work or take any tests to demonstrate knowledge or anything The course has limited value as a credential if it's trivial easy to pass by flipping through the videos On the other hands the presenter seems to know her stuff and presents it in an engaging and concise format so thank you for that ,3
175,Amazing course Will seek other opportunities with this instructor ,5
176,Fun Little course ,4
177,So far so good I am liking it The pace is a little fast the content is intriguing and dense The lectures might benefit from a slower pace and more deliberate pauses during delivery to enable the learner to connect the more nuanced dots in the rich nuggets presented ,4

189,Im very intrigued by the functioning of the brain and Prof pen's first 2 sessions have helped clarify quite a few doubts looking forward to the rest of the course ,4
190,Anette started out great explaining how the brain works but I feel she rushed the practical side a little more examples could have been introduced ,3

202,Great course ,5
203,Good course but needs to simplify new concepts or terminology especially for those that are unfamiliar with such ,4
204,Great course with practical & relevant examples for business and personal application I like that it starts of each concept with the science but moves quickly to the application making it very easy to understand or apply from my frame of reference i ,4.5
205,I enjoyed the personable approach Anette used Thank you for the engaging and thought-provoking information ,5

223,This course is brilliant The Danish Social scientists Anette preen gives this free taster course on Reframing also known as Cognitive reappraisal a way to adjust your focus and thinking that can benefit you in all areas of your life I highly recommend this course as she gives a wealth of information in neuroscience in an incredibly usable and digestible way ,5

234,It's interesting ,4
235,I am obtaining more valuable information as the class develops THe more connections I draw the more interesting the class becomes ,5
236,I thought I was capable of asserting another person's views from a second person perspective But after the section on perceptual positions I really doubt my capability 5 perceptual positions seems sort of overwhelming but would be cool if some one could achieve command over such a tool or rather I would call it a 'superpower'. The course was pretty illuminating and presentation had a superior level of clarity Thanks Anette ,4.5
237,Great ,3.5
238,"There is not so much news for me yet because of my work and that I have read ""Brain-Smart children but it fully meets my expectations ",3.5

261,I truly enjoyed this course I worked in neurosurgery as a scribe in the past and truly learned the most in this field of medicine From the basic information or granular information when it comes to the anatomy of the brain such as the amygdala and how it is basically the reason as to why people are afraid of things that are beyond there control - to a more broad explanation of the limbic system as a whole It gives examples on how to appropriately handle these emotions and situations - this course is my favorite #outofsync #loseyourlink ,5

384,This information was helpful insofar as it gave strategies on how to approach a limbic system already in flight additionally the knowledge that both the hippocampus and the amygdala are both plastic and that there is an inverse relationship between the growth of the two regions allows for targeted development of the hippocampus valuable ,4.5
385,Excellent ,5
386,interesting and useful content ,4
387,Very interesting topic However - my description of this course is data dump Too many words and too much texts and the sections are too long When the woman is reading and I am presented with a lot of text what should I do listen to her or interpret the text The chapters following the amygdala chapter were much better ,4
388,I think there was a lot of theory but not really HOW to ,4
389,I learned a tremendous amount about the amygdala and it is giving me a lot to reflect on Annette brings the concepts and teachings to us in an easy to understand and engaging manner ,5
390,This course delivers the messages that she promised and the messages that I expected clearly My brain feels very satisfied ,5
391,I enjoyed this course ,5

404,excellent Has started me thinking and approaching stress in my life differently ,5
405,I sure got a lot out of this course Silo mentality was new to me I liked the scenario of a bank robbery that would make me value every day of my life This reframing course was great thank you ,5
406,She overwhelms me gives a lot of new information but she gives slow-old me time to catch up and to catch my breath If I didn't have a finger in every pie have lots of projects I'd be writing to her even now Maybe I'll be able to do that two months later And oh - what a beautiful speaking voice ,5
407,Thank you Annette for sharing this course ! This is a great tool for anyone who wants to be a better human being or better professional Great easy tool to change our perception ,5

409,Really appreciated the content and the way it was presented Will use this in my life both at work and in my relationships with other people thank you ,4.5
410,I have previously done several online courses with full of fun facts experiments famous personalities... but the take home message is crystal clear in this course with the correct strategies of learning and fun ,5
411,excellent insights with accessible methods for personal use and as a coach with the focus on science ,5
412,I enjoyed the material in this course and I actually learned a lot of new information The reason I'm giving this course a 3 star is that there was too much info packed in each section and the tools were almost an after thought I'd appreciate a more structured approach to using the tools / writing exercises also the sections could be a bit shorter / the voice over more abbreviated The speaker says a lot of information ....maybe consider more visuals more pauses during the lecture and slowing down as you share the stories ,3
413,"wow You absolute start Anette... making a hard science of reframing Magnificent work if I may say With 50 years extensive self-knowledge, and a wide gamut of studies and teachings of personal and spiritual growth under my belt its always struck me how important the stories we tell ourselves about our own experiences are to our quality of life I've become a master at reframing and I love to help others see life circumstances specific events and even their whole life from different viewpoints This is a significant life coping skill that ought to be taught in schools So glad to see a free course here for beginners but tying it in with hard science gives it the weight it needs for such skills to be taught formally The explanations make the concepts very clear and the exercises are ell placed to give course students a direct experience of how easy and effective it is to change one's own viewpoint and thereby change our beliefs feelings and behaviours I've thoroughly enjoyed going through this course and can't wait to start dry pen's Framestorm course ",5
414,This course is loaded with very informative information and delivered in a very effective matter I feel like my time was well spent and I look forward to reading the author's book play your mind ,5

421,i like it And has good advice for dealing with the brain and good conduct ,5
422,Great content high quality course never boring ,5
423,Excellent content very useful ,5
424,The information is of immense used Applied to direct experience negative behavioural reactions to events - even misperceived ones - can be witnessed understood worked with and transcended If the entire world began to work with this kind of model we'd fast come to a point of greatly diminished conflict I'm glad that neuroscience and psychology can provide for us this kind of insight and methodology ,5
425,fabulous ,5
426,Very few scientific reference ,2
427,Understandable theory linked to practical used for significant improvement ,5
428,It's actually getting pretty good maybe i judged to quickly ,3.5

510,"This is a really interesting course and one I am very glad I took There are various techniques covered for reframing non of which I had heard of before and non of which gave me the instant urge to say yeah but what if...""

523,This is a really good course for anyone You do a really good job explaining all the aspects of diving into reframing which is something everyone at any level should try to do Society is very good at finger pointing or passing the buck so to say which is the easiest thing to do - but one of the hardest things to do is taking that finger and repainting it back at themselves I will definitely look into more of your material and if able take the other non-free courses as well All the best to your continued work and to hopefully more people getting to look through the correct lenses ,5
